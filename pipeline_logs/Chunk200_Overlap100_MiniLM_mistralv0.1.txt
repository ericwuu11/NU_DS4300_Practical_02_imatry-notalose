Question: What is the purpose of data replication?
Response:
Data replication is used in Redis to ensure that multiple instances of the database have a consistent view of its contents. This is useful for building highly available systems where the database can fail or become unresponsive, and the application needs to continue functioning without interruption. Replication also allows for read scaling, as multiple instances can be used to serve read queries concurrently, improving the overall performance of the system.

Question: Explain key-value databases with examples.
Response:
Key-Value Databases, also known as Simple Key-Value Stores or Distributed Key-Value Stores, are a type of NoSQL database that store data in the form of key-value pairs. The key is used to retrieve the associated value from the database. In simple words, a key-value database is like a dictionary where each word (key) has its corresponding meaning (value).

Here are some examples of Key-Value Databases:

1. Redis - It's an in-memory key-value database used for caching and fast data access. Examples of using Redis include storing website session data, caching frequently accessed data, and performing real-time analytics.
2. Riak - It's a distributed key-value store designed for high availability and fault tolerance. Riak is used in various industries like finance, gaming, and e-commerce for tasks such as session management, user authentication, and content recommendation.
3. Amazon DynamoDB - It's a NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services that offers scalable key-value storage with seamless integration into other AWS services. DynamoDB is used in various applications like web analytics, e-commerce, and mobile apps.
4. MongoDB - It's a document-oriented NoSQL database that can be used as a key-value store. MongoDB is used for storing and querying large amounts of data, such as website user data, social media posts, and product catalogs.

Key-Value Databases are commonly used in applications where fast and efficient retrieval of data is required. They offer high scalability and can handle a large number of concurrent read and write operations. However, they have limited query capabilities compared to other types of databases, like relational databases, which can perform more complex queries on structured data.

Question: How does the AVL tree maintain balance?
Response:
The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance by adjusting the height of its nodes. When a node is inserted or deleted, the tree will rebalance itself to ensure that the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced and efficient in terms of search and insertion operations.

To maintain balance, the AVL tree uses a simple set of rules:

1. If the height of the left subtree is taller than the right subtree, the parent node is considered to be "left-heavy." To fix this, the parent will rotate to the right, and the child node that caused the imbalance will become the new root of the left subtree.
2. If the height of the right subtree is taller than the left subtree, the parent node is considered to be "right-heavy." To fix this, the parent will rotate to the left, and the child node that caused the imbalance will become the new root of the right subtree.
3. If the heights of both subtrees are equal, the parent node is considered to be "balanced."

By using these rules, the AVL tree can maintain balance after each insertion or deletion operation. This ensures that search and insertion operations are efficient, even in the presence of changes to the data.

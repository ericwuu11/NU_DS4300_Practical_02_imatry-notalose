Question: What is the purpose of data replication?
Response:
Data replication is used in Redis to maintain multiple copies of a database on different servers or instances, typically for high availability and fault tolerance purposes. By keeping multiple copies of the same data, if one copy goes down due to hardware failure or network outage, another instance can take over and continue serving requests without interruption. This ensures that the application remains available and responsive even in the event of a single point of failure. In addition to availability benefits, replication can also improve performance by allowing read operations to be distributed across multiple nodes.

Question: Explain key-value databases with examples.
Response:

Key-value databases are a type of NoSQL database that store data as key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value, which can be anything from a simple string to a complex data structure. The keys and values are stored in memory, making them fast and efficient for retrieving data. Some examples of key-value databases include Redis, Riak, and Amazon DynamoDB. In the context of Redis, key-value pairs are used to store data that needs to be accessed quickly, such as user session data or caching data. Vector databases, on the other hand, store high-dimensional embeddings for similarity search. HNSW indexing enables fast vector search in Redis by creating an index of the embeddings, which allows for efficient querying of similar vectors.

Question: How does the AVL tree maintain balance?
Response:

AVL trees use a balancing factor to maintain balance between nodes. The balancing factor is calculated as the height of the right subtree minus the height of the left subtree. When the balancing factor becomes larger than 1 or smaller than -1, the tree needs to be rebalanced.

To rebalance the tree, the algorithm performs a series of rotations and adjusts the heights of the nodes. The exact steps depend on which rotation is needed to balance the tree.

The main idea behind the balancing algorithm is to always maintain a height difference of at most 1 between the left and right subtrees. This ensures that the tree remains balanced and efficient for searching and inserting elements.
